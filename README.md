This program is designed to take in words as input through one of 3 ways:
./Project0 [filename]
./Project0
./Project0 < [filename]
Doing the second option will let the user enter in words until they enter the EOF command CTRL+D
The program will then put the words into a ternary tree and output 3 files of ordering
InOrder, PostOrder, and PreOrder
